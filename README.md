    ## Description
      Everytime I'm eager to finish up a project I've poured my heart and soul into, I inevitably have to compose a readme. What a drag! Gone are the days of wasting a handful of commits and half an hour of your time attempting to throw together a readme that doesn't do your labor justice. Navigate through your terminal to the readmeGen directory, run the node command on the index.js file and watch your beautiful readme come to life!
